# Lewis Freeman Billing Better Coding Challenge

Uses Laradock for local development, I assume you have Docker installed on your systems.

### Directions to bring the project up
- On your command line navigate to the `laradock` folder of this project
- Run `docker-compose up -d nginx mysql` this may take a few minutes the first time run
- Run `docker-compose exec workspace bash` to enter the `workspace container`
- Within the workspace container run `su laradock` to change to the laradock user
- Run `composer install`
- Run `cp  .env.example .env`
- Run `php artisan key:generate`
- Run `php artisan migrate:fresh` or `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` if you want it seed with data

After all that is done, Run `php artisan queue:work` to start the queue worker


To verify the endpoints work correctly, you can either use Postman or Curl.
If using postman, I personally use `project.localhost` as the url which will be auto translated to `127.0.0.1` by chromium 

#### Curl Examples
To see properties
```
curl http://127.0.0.1/property
```

To create a property
```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1/property -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"address":{"line_1":"10","line_2":"Test Street","postcode":"E11AA"}}'
```
To check the status of the job
```
curl http://127.0.0.1/batch/{batch_id}
``` 
(Batch ID return from create route)


To easily submit a batch of 100 properties please run the below command.
```

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1/property -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"address":[{"line_1":"101 Craig Garden","line_2":null,"postcode":"CB9 9EE"},{"line_1":"152 Lee
